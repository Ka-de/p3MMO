# (MMO)RPG Maker MV

## Summary
This is a project I started in 2016 and on which I worked for only few weeks. In 2019 I stumbled upon an old version of the code which I have tested & refactored (a little bit). I also decided to restart working on it on my free time - which I almost have not - and open source it with the hopes that some other cool people upgrade it!

## History
I have used RPG Maker since its 2000 version. Discovered it when I was a kid and used it to make many (very bad) games. It clearly impacted a lot on my creativity and my development desires. Later on, as a French-speaking person, I discovered a (now dead) project named FROG Creator which was a dedicated at creating MMORPG in a RPG Maker-like environment. 

With the release of RPG MAKER MV which allows usage of JavaScript and its HTML5 export, I decided to give it a try and discovered quickly that yes, RPG Maker MV could easily be used to create an MMORPG creator interface.
